## Getting Started

I considered this project for the 6th semester of university
I made this project once in my 4th semester of university in React, I got the idea of this project from:
- [ Frontend Mentor ] https://www.frontendmentor.io/ , and many of my solutions are similar to my React project which is The project is also available in my GitHub Repository.
On the first page of my program, the clock is shown in two ways, one digital and the other as a wall clock, and it still shows us the date of the same day, and in the bottom part, it shows the time zone of Afghanistan.
After the first page or Clock, by clicking on the Alarm on the left side, we can access our Note Alarm page. In fact, my first idea was that I should create a program where the user can write his daily notes and can time it, but due to the simplicity of the first theory, I changed my original idea, in any case, on this page you can set your alarm at what time the corresponding clock will alert you [like an alarm clock ]
- By clicking on Add Alarm, you can open your Alarm page.
- The clock is displayed in the upper part. By clicking on the clock, you will go to the page for specifying the clock   for the alarm.
- And then by clicking on Sound, you can access your desired sound. [Under Process]
- If you click on Title, you can give your alarm a specific title.
- And then by clicking on Save, your alarm clock will be set.
